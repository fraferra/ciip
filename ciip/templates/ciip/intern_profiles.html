    <br>Projects: Inventory Parsing and Profiling.<br>FY14</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What do you like most about the Cisco work culture?</p>
    <p class="lead">
    "I like the remote working environment most, employees don’t need to sit together physically. Several Cisco products like Webex and Jabber Video allow for people to work together from different locations, and such technologies also make working from home a possibility."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What has been your best experience so far?</p>
    <p class="lead">"The best experience I’ve been through was a trip to San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge is great, and driving up and down the super steep Lombard street was also very exciting."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What work related events have you attended?</p>
    <p class="lead">"I have attended the Yahoo hackathon where I developed a Chrome extension along with my teammates. I was also very lucky to have a short conversation with Yahoo CEO; Marissa Mayer (see picture). I told her that Yahoo should have a International Internship Program as well, and she said she will consider it."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">How is American culture different from your home country?</p>
    <p class="lead">"American people are more open minded and like to share their feelings with others. If you want to speak to someone, just say it, even if he or she is your manager."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What were some of the first things that shocked you when coming to America?</p>
    <p class="lead">"The weather here is amazing, since it was extremely hot in China when I left. The Woods Apartments were also beyond my expectations, with pools, spas, gyms and other awesome facilities. Living there is really enjoyable. The Cisco Campus is so large, and there is even a street called Cisco Way!"</p>

    <br>Project: Cisco.com<br>FY13</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What work related events did you attend and what did you enjoy most about it/them?</p>
    <p class="lead">
    "Being in the Silicon Valley gives you the chance to attend events, which are not only insightful but also provide a great opportunity to network. During my time at Cisco, I attended conferences held by my team, which had guest speakers from various companies. This included a visit to Stanford’s Design School to brainstorm ideas to improve the processes and procedures to help our team. It was a very creative and thought-provoking experience, which made us think outside the box."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What were some of the first things that shocked you when coming to America?</p>
    <p class="lead">"The working culture in the US is quite different from the UK, this was something new to me but I was pleasantly surprised to experience it. Also driving on the right side of the road was something different initially but as time passed by I became used to it."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What was the most difficult part of coming to the US?</p>
    <p class="lead">"Leaving behind family and friends for a year, along with taking a break from my studies was something I had not done before. It was initially difficult but it did not take me long at all to adjust to the new work-life experience and start making the most out of it."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">Any recommendations and advice for current and future CIIP interns?</p>
    <p class="lead">"CIIP is a great opportunity and future interns should take every opportunity by learning new things at work, experiencing a new culture and exploring the Bay Area. It gives tremendous opportunities to network, acquire new knowledge and broaden your current skills set."

    <br>Projects: Cloud storage. Storage monitoring, management and alerting. Storage automation. HackIT (hackathon events).<br>FY12</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">Reflecting back on your internship in the US, what was your best experience while in the States?</p>
    <p class="lead">
    "Honestly I can’t really pick out “my best experience”. Everything about my year was incredible. My work was enjoyable, my colleagues were great, the social life was amazing."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">How did your internship affect the way you work, live, learn and play?</p>
    <p class="lead">"This is an easy question. CIIP definitely enhanced the way I work, because I learned so much from so many intelligent experts. It’s also changed the way I live because it taught me to look at the world from a different “global” perspective. Finally, when you work hard, you have to make sure you have a good work/life balance to make the most of the experience."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">Do you believe that CIIP was a life-changing experience? If so, in what way?</p>
    <p class="lead">"I have definitely grown both as a professional and as a person. It’s not something you can really explain, it has to be lived. I strongly suggest you apply and find out for yourself."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">What are you working on now that you are a full-time employee for Cisco UK?</p>
    <p class="lead">"I am working on a few projects currently. I am developing a monitoring and alerting tool for an open source cloud storage system (Ceph) which is in production within the CITEIS stack. I am also working on storage automation for NAS and SAN within CITEIS. Finally, I work alongside Sergios and Phil on organizing hackathon events within cisco and across different universities in the UK."</p>
    <p class="lead" style="color:#0096D6;">Any recommendations and advice for current and future CIIP interns?</p>
    <p class="lead">"Put 100% in and you will gain so much from it – both personally and professionally. Work hard and don’t be afraid to say yes to things that you are unsure of. Make use of your time outside of work too, California is a great place to explore and (within silicon valley especially) meet leaders in technology."
